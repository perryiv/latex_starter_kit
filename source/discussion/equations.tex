All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
Make sure you look at equations
\ref{eq:newton_force} and
\ref{eq:einstein_energy}.
Here's a short inline equation $P_i = F_1$.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:newton_force}
F = m a
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:einstein_energy}
e = m c ^ 2
\end{equation}
